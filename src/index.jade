        h1 Today we are going to talk about sound
      
      section(data-bespoke-backdrop='krang')
        h1 Specifically how our brains interpret sound in space
        
      section(data-bespoke-backdrop='brain')
        h1 So we can hack our brains
        
      section(data-bespoke-backdrop='trippy')
        h1 Placing in sounds in space.
      
      section(data-bespoke-backdrop='space')
        h1 To space your face.

      section(data-bespoke-backdrop='melon-head')
        h1 Imagine, your head is a melon

      section
        h1 I know what you are thinking

        h1 Melons do not have ears silly

      section(data-bespoke-backdrop='trippy-too')
        h1 Trippy, eh?
      
      section
        h1 Your perception would be tripping too!
        
      section
        h2 Our brains can easily decipher
        h3 how far away a sound is.
        h3 and if the sound is coming from your left or right.
        
      section
        h1 The amount of energy reaching each ear gives this away
      
      section
        h1 Louder sounds are closer, softer further away
      
      section
        h2 If the sound reaches a particular ear first
        h3 we know about the direction it came from
        
      section
        h1 But if we were a floating melon in an anechoic chamber
      
      section
        h1 We would have no way of knowing the height of the sound
      
      section
        h1 We would also have no idea if it was coming from in front or behind
      
      section
        h2 Thankfully we are not floating melon heads
        h3 with holes for ears in anechoic chambers!
      
      section
        h2 Our ear lobes and body act as a filter,
        h3 leaving a unique signature on the waveform
      
      section
        h2 Our brains are able to decode this signature
        h3 and place the sounds accordingly
      
      section(data-bespoke-backdrop='doors')
        h2 The Doors of Perception are Opened
        h3 What can we do with this knowledge?
      
      section
        h1 It turns out that sometimes our heads are melons with holes for ears in an anechoic chamber
        
      section
        h1 Everytime we put on headphones!
      
      section
        h2 We can use principals of signal processing
        h3 to create filters
        h4 that can emulate our body's signature
      
      section
        h1 HRTF
        h4 Head related transfer function
        
      section
        h1 What is a transfer function
      
      section
        h2 Some mathy shit
        h3 fancy way of saying a black box
        h4 with defined input and output
      
      section
        h3 signal ➡️ transfer-function ➡️ modified-signal
      
      section
        h2 With an HRTF we can provice an audio signal
        h3 a position in space
        h4 and get back a binaural stereo signal
      
      section
        h2 Binaural is a classic form a spatialized recording
        h3 where two microphones are placed on a model where the ears should be
        h4 this model could likely be a melon with two holes
      
      section
        h1 We have HRTF in the browser!
        
      section
        h1 The panner node!

        h1 Demo Time
      
      Section
        h3 I'm Probably out of time by now, but if I'm not I should ramble about Ambisonics and Wavefield arrays
